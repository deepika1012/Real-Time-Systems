Static Scheduling using Network Flow Algorithm

The input.dat file consists of a set of synchronous tasks.

Run the script INF.py using the following command

python INF.py

The output is a suitable schedule based on the schedulability conditions.
The maxflow determined by the Ford Fulkerson agorithm is used to analyse the schedulability
